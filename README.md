# Weekly-Challenge1-Sarmiento-Salas

## Description 

The purpose of this week's challenge was to refactor some code to give the code semantic elements.

Given some starter code, changes were made to make the code have meaning. Below are examples of changes made:

- in the `<head>` section: added an appropriate `<title>` description, in order for the browser tab to display a relevant title.
- added `<header>` element to replace `<div>` 
- added `<nav>` element for the navigation bar to replace `<div>`
- added `<main>` element to replace `<div>` for the main content of the page
-added `<section>` elements for each section of the main content, replacing `<div>`
- each `<section>` under `<main>` was given an `<id>` in order for the `<nav>` links to function properly
- `<img>` elements in each section were given `<alt>` attributes
- added `<aside>` element to replace `<div>` for the benefits section of the webpage
- added `<section>` to replace `<div>` for each of the benefits
-   `<img>` elements in each section were given `<alt>` attributes
- added `<footer>` element to replace `<div>` for the footer section of the webpage
- the CSS code selectors were updated to reflect the changes to the new elements, ids, and classes
- the CSS code was cleaned up to consolidate any repeat call outs to one line of code

**Note:** The hero `<div>` was not changed in order for the functionality of the webpage to remain. The hero does not provide any context to the main content, therefore it was left as `<div>`.
